# student_18_explorer
A Skipchain Explorer

In this project, we build an Explorer for SkipChains. The platform allows users to navigate through the blocks of a SkipChain by having access to their Block Information page. The platform also gives a visual identity to SkipChains by representing them and their parameters.

SkipBlocks from ByzCoin SkipChains have a particular display as they can hold multiple transactions.

A default Roster is used to give access to a first set of SkipChains, but users are welcome to log their own personal Roster.
